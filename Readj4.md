# jQuery 
 - is a library that contains a set of quick and small functions, especially JavaScript, and this library makes using JavaScript easier on your website. Built with jQuery, the operations you need on your excuse are shortened from lines of lines in a freeze pool of functions called by a single line.

## ACCESS CONTENT
- You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page. For example:
- • Select the text inside all of the <hl> elements on a page
- • Select any elements that have ac 1 ass attribute with a value of note
- • Find out what was entered into atext input whose id attribute has avalue of ema i 

## MODIFY CONTENT
- You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. For example:
- • Add a paragraph of text after the first <hl> element
- • Change the value of c 1 ass attributes to trigger new CSS rules for those elements
- • Change the size or position of an <i mg> element 

 ### You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page. For example:
- • A gallery script could check which image a user clicked on and display a larger version of that image.
- • A mortgage calculator could collect values from a form, perform a ca lculation, and display repayments.
- • An animation could check the dimensions of the browser window and move an image to the bottom of the viewable area (also known as the viewport).

 # Here are six rules you must always follow when giving a variable a name:

- The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start
with a number.

- All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names, but
it is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.

- The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you
must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name.

- Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores. For example,
fi rstName might be used to store a person's first name, l astNarne for their last name,
and age for their age.

- You cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords are special words that tell the
interpreter to do something. For example, var is a keyword used to declare a variable. Reserved
words are ones that may be used in a future version of JavaScript.

 - If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of
every word after the first word.
 - For example, f i rstName rather than fi rstnarne (this is referred to as camel case).
 You can also use an underscore between each word (you cannot use a dash).
