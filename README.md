#### who am I?
##### To Whom It May Concern,
I have a BSc Degree in Management Information Systems from the
Ahliya University, Amman.

I worked in the field of furniture as Sales Assistant and Warehouse
Supervisor for three years prior to my college admission. Then, I got
an opportunity to work in the Hospitality field for a year and a half.
During my academic studies, I worked in different fields of manual
work like agriculture, construction and being in charge of
the site and workers. After graduation, I worked in maintenance,
moving furniture, house painting, electricity and gardening.

My goal is to meet new people and acquire experience in business
leadership.
