# Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,
green, and blue. 
- To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.
Understanding Color Computer monitors are made up of thousands of tiny squares
called pixels (if you look very closely at your monitor you should be able to see them).
When the screen is not turned on, it's black because it's not emitting any light. When it's
on, each pixel can be a different color, creating a picture.
The color of every pixel on the screen is expressed in terms of a mix of red, green, and blue â€”
just like on a television screen. 
Color picking tools are available in image editing programs like Photoshop and GIMP. 
## The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:
### rgb values
- These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90)
 ### hex codes
- These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80
### color names
- There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers. For example:
DarkCyan
